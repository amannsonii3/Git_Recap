# README

.md - markdown type files: holds various symbols for different commands and text font playing stuff (hashtags-headers, *asterisks*, __underscores__, etc.)

Cloning : can be done via SSH(using a key) or HTTPS(I used this will try the other one next time soon).

## Subheader

Ohh! Btw double hash can give you a sub-header.

git status : shows all the file that were updated, created or deleted but **haven't been saved in a commit yet.**

first : you do git add .(_for tracking all the changes and new files created all together_)
        else git add _filename_(_individually updating/tracking every file and their changes_)

second : you commit those changes via : git commit -m "_the message_" -m "_The description of the message_"

thirdly : you have so far done all this in your local machine, now you have to push it on the GitHub as well so: git push
